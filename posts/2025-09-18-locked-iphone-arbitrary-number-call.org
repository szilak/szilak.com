* Prerequisites
Physical access to a locked iPhone with default configuration after first unlock (incl. Lockdown Mode (https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120)).

* Steps to Reproduce
1. Use Spotlight Search to search for a Phone Number (with proper country codes e.g., +36 for Hungary).
2. Tap on the number label itself (not the phone icon) to call arbitrary phone numbers that are **not saved in the contact list**.

:END:
Tapping the *Phone Number text label itself* shown in Spotlight Search results calls the Entered Phone Number. It is also possible to call Premium-Rate Phone Numbers (/Phone thievery comeback is real lolðŸ’€ðŸ¥€/). 

Enter any unsaved Phone Number:

Possible Remediation: As used in the Email sending feature, *Calling should also require the user to unlock the device* except when calling an emergency number.
