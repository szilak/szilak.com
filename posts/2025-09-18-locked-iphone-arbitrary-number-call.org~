* Summary
/Phone Numbers **not saved in the contact list** could be called by using Spotlight Search without unlocking the device./

* Prerequisites
A locked iPhone with default configuration after first unlock or locked iPhone with default configuration in Lockdown Mode after first unlock.

* Steps to Reproduce
1. Use Spotlight Search to search for a Phone Number (with proper country codes e.g., +36 for Hungary).
2. Tap on the number label (not the phone icon -- note: sometimes it works with the phone icon itself but it was indeterministic while testing) to call arbitrary phone numbers that are **not saved in the contact list**.
