* Summary
/Contact information could be leaked from a locked iPhone (after first unlock) by using spotlight search./

* Prerequisites
A locked iPhone with default configuration after first unlock or locked iPhone with default configuration in Lockdown Mode after first unlock.

* Steps to Reproduce
1. Use spotlight search to search for a Phone Number (with proper country coding e.g., +36 for Hungary)/Email Address.
2. If the Phone Number/Email Address is in the Contact List, there will be *no* option to Call/Email them (only search in safari shows up).

With this behavior it is possible to brute force Phone Numbers/Email Addresses saved in the contact list of the *locked* iPhone by using a "negative lookup". Please also note that, this behavior could also be replicated in iPhone Lockdown Mode (https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120).
