* Prerequisites
Physical access to a locked iPhone with default configuration after first unlock (incl. Lockdown Mode (https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120)).

* Steps to Reproduce
1. Use Spotlight Search to search for a Phone Number (with proper country coding e.g., +36 for Hungary)/Email Address.
2. If the Phone Number/Email Address is in the Contact List, there will be *no* option to Call/Email them (only search in safari shows up).

Add Email shows up when an Unsaved Contact is hit:

It's the same with Phone Numbers...

Phone Number is SAVED IN Contact List:

Phone Number is NOT saved in Contact List:

Possible Remediation: Only show Add Number/Email option *after* unlocking the device to avoid Contact Information Disclosure.
